In this project we are going to develop an &quot;Interesting Calculator&quot; with the help to our Data Structres and Algorithm knowledge.

This article contains the following details about the project :

1. Folder Structure

2. User Interface and design

3. Important concepts

4. Functions and Formulas used

5. Complete code

6. Link to application

How to read this article?

Read, seriously ! I have attached a video with this article. Watch and understand the video first and then have a look at written material. Thats all you need.

If you are trying to create your own sample app, concept is all you need. Assuming that you are familier with the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React or any other tech stack you use. Just undestand the concept and apply it own your own. Of course you can take help from my code.

My article always take visual approach, so I have attached lots of pics and I believe you can understand everything just by looking at pics.

Tech Stack - ReactJs, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and BootStrap.

1. Folder Structure -

2. User Interface and design

3. Important concepts -

In this project, I have used the following concept -

1. What is Array Deque?

An ArrayDeque (also known as an &quot;Array Double Ended Queue&quot;, pronounced as &quot;ArrayDeck&quot;) is a special kind of a growable array that allows us to add or remove an element from both sides. An ArrayDeque implementation can be used as a Stack (Last-In-First-Out) or a Queue(First-In-First-Out).

In javascript, we have array which have properties like shift, unshift, push, pop.

We can make use of it and implement the solution.

2. How calculator works?

Lets understand with example -

eg : Find the result of &quot;234 \* 9&quot;

We will break the question into 3 parts, input1, operator, input2.

input1 = 234

input2 = 9

operator = \*

we will use, result = input1 \* input2

Now, next question is how to seperate out input1 and input2?

4. Functions and Formulas used

handleInputChange : Invokes when user enters into input field like number or operator.

handleBackspace : Invokes when user delete the input.

handleOperation : Invokes when user clicks on operator.

handleCalculate : Invokes when user clicks on &quot;=&quot; button to perform calculations.

handleClearInput : Invokes when user want to clear input/output.
